# Logos #
For each group, we’ve created a logomark and a wordmark. There’s currently no guidelines on using the two together. For using either of them in general though, we suggest making sure the margins for logomarks are at least ¼ its height/width, and the margins for wordmarks are ½ of its height.

An exception to this would be when using them in conjunction with each other, or with extra “branded” elements like the committee taglines.

## Logomarks ##
Our logomark takes inspiration from ACM's official diamond-shaped logo. Each has an icon representing each committee's topic of focus.

### Suggested Usage for logomarks ###
Use logomarks when you are limited in the space you're given to insert branding. (Ex: Laptop Sticker)

### Suggested Usage for wordmarks ###
Try to use wordmarks in conjunction with the logomarks. If this isn't possible, make sure the sizing of the wordmark clearly establishes the committee as the group of ownership.
