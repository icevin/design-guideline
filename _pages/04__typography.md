# Typography #
UCLA ACM uses three main typefaces: Poppins, Palanquin Dark, and Chivo. 

{% include "type.html", family: "Poppins", weight: "700" %}
As our main display typeface, [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins "Poppins on Google Fonts") is used for virtually all content with ACM branding. It's fun and friendly, and represents what we want our events to be like. As such, Poppins is the foundation for all our committees' wordmarks. We suggest using this whenever you want your content to have a strong association with ACM.

{% include "type.html", family: "Palanquin Dark", weight: "700" %}
[Palanquin Dark](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Palanquin+Dark "Palanquin Dark on Google Fonts") is our main header typeface, which we use on all our websites when we have copy/headings that speak, not show. It has a more organic vibe compared to Poppins. We suggest using Palanquin Dark on your website headings, but not for graphics.

{% include "type.html", family: "Chivo", weight: "400" %}
[Chivo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chivo "Chivo on Google Fonts") is our main body typeface. It's design is more similar to tech aesthetics, and can be used for casual copy, or more serious situations. We suggest using Chivo for smaller UI elements and body text.

## Keep it Poppins' ##
There aren't really strict guidelines on how to use these typefacesâ€”designing with them is up to your discretion. Likewise, there's no need to adhere to these type families, as they may change in the future. That being said, when in doubt and don't care about font specifics, use Poppins.
